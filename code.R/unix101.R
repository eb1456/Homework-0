# echo "hello world"

# pwd = print working dir;

# / represents the ROOT directory;
# When a path starts with "/", it is a "full path", which finds the current directory from the root directory

# ~ represents the HOME/WORKING directory; ie ~/photos
# ie cd ~ gives you the home directory vs cd / gives you ROOT

# ls = list contents

#mkdir and rmdir ie mkdir projects then rmdir projects, creates and removes EMPTY directories only

#to remove real dir w contents -> rm

#cd .. means go up a level, or can concatanate; ie cd ../.. takes you up 2 levels;

#cd . means stay where you are, ie '.' = current dir;

#cd - takes you back wherever you just were;

#cd alone - takes you to home directory;
